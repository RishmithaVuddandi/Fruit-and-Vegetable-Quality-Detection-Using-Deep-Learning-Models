We explored the effectiveness of using a pre-trained models for detecting and classifying the quality of fruits and vegetables as either fresh or rotten. By applying transfer learning, the model was fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of fruit and vegetable images, enabling it to identify subtle quality differences. Data preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation helped improve the model’s robustness and generalization during training. Fine-tuning the deeper layers of the model further enhanced its ability to deeper relevant features.
In our study, we compared ResNet50 with another popular architecture, EfficientNetB4. While both models showed strong performance, ResNet50 outperformed EfficientNetB4 in terms of training and validation accuracy, indicating better reliability in quality detection tasks. This highlights ResNet50’s residual learning advantage when dealing with diverse and complex image datasets.
